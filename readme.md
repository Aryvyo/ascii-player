# ASCII EVERYTHING!!!

simple script that converts images and videos to ASCII for your viewing, right in your terminal of choice!

Supports colour where there is 24-bit colour support, and runs at about 30fps, however your mileage may vary depending on terminal, hardware etc

I didn't tell you this but if you comment out the `time.sleep()` you could probably get 60fps, just saying...

## Usage 

` main.py [file] [-args] `

## Arguments

`-c` runs the script with colour support, can be buggy with buffering sometimes

`-f` uses an alternative, larger set of ASCII characters


## 

feel free to fork, star, do whatever! This was a fun 3 hour project
